# WWDC18-Scholarship-Submission

This playground was created using the macOS SDK. The core technologies used are AppKit for the heads up display and SceneKit for the game visuals and physics. The playground is a time trial style racing game, in which the user controls an open-wheel race car and attempts to achieve a short lap time. To model the 3D assets, including the car, track, mountains, and grandstands, I used Blender. The textures for these assets were created and edited using Affinity Designer, and the sound that is played when the user achieves a fast lap time was created in GarageBand. I wanted my track layout to be fairly simplistic to drive, yet feature elements commonly found on race tracks around the world. This resulted in two chicanes located on the back straight, multiple 90 degree turns, and a flat-out left hand turn leading onto the main straight. When designing the controls for this game my goal was to keep them simple and intuitive, so I chose the common "WASD" format. "W" accelerates the car, "A" and "D" steer the car left and right, and "S" applies the brake, or reverses the car. Additionally, the camera angle can be changed between a chase cam and a driver POV cam using "C". To achieve physics similar to that of a race car, I used SceneKit's `SCNPhysicsVehicle` physics behavior. This allowed me to easily accelerate and steer the car by applying an engine force and steering angle, resulting in a behavior that was easy to map to the controls.
